# airbnb-clone-project
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## UI/UX Design Planning
Document design goals and key features
Create page descriptions for main views
Analyze Figma design specifications
Identify color schemes and typography

### Primary Pages: 
Property Listing View: Grid display of available properties with filters
Listing Detailed View: Complete property details with images and booking form
Simple Checkout View: Streamlined payment and booking confirmation

### Importance of user friendly designs: 
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.
